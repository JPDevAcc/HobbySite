							Computers go back a long way!
							How long exactly depends on your definition, 
							but the first general-purpose, fully electronic, digital computer that could store and modify a program in main memory is generally accepted to be
							the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby" target="_blank">Manchester Baby</a>, built in 1948. You probably wouldn't want this machine in your office
							(unless it was a very big office!) and it was exceedingly slow by today's standards but it was nevertheless an important milestone in the history of computing.

							Fast-forward to 1971 and we have the first commercially produced CPU, the Intel 4004, followed by the better-known Intel 8088 in 1979
							which powered the first IBM-compatible PCs. If you're using a computer today, there's a very good chance that at its heart is a CPU that comes from the 8088 lineage.

							My own interest mostly lies in the home systems of the 80s and early 90s.
							This period represented an amazing growth in the accessibilty of computing to the general public, 
							although early computers of this era were not necessarily the most user-friendly of devices.
						</p>
						<p>
							There existed a number of contenders in the home computer market. 
							In the early to late 80s, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a>
							was very popular internationally (except in Japan). This machine was quite impressive for its time, 
							with custom graphics and audio hardware that also made it an effective gaming machine.
						</p>

						<p>
							Another system released the same year was the cheaper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum" target="_blank">ZX Spectrum</a>. 
							This computer went on to become Britain's best-selling microcomputer and earned its creator, Clive Sinclair, a knighthood for his contributions to British industry.
							While not as capable as the Commodore 64, and no-where near as popular internationally, this was neverthless an era-defining home-computer for those in the UK.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the UK, there was also a third home-computer released at roughly the same time as the C64 and Spectrum.
							This was Acorn Computers' "BBC Micro" range, so-named because Acorn had won a contract with the British Broadcasting Corporation to provide a 
							system to accompany their <a href="https://clp.bbcrewind.co.uk/" target="_blank">Computer Literacy Project</a>.
							While more expensive than the ZX Spectrum, this was a very versatile machine, and found its way into many schools.

						<p>
							Later on, between the mid-80s and the early 90s, a new generation of systems became available - the "16/32-bit" computers.
							These could carry out calculations at a much faster rate and in bigger 'chunks' at a time, 
							resulting in significantly improved capabilities compared to the earlier "8-bit" machines.
						</p>

						<p>
							These included the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" target="_blank">Commodore Amiga</a>, 
							the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST" target="_blank">Atari ST</a>,
							the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes" target="_blank">"Archimedes" range from Acorn Computers</a>,
							and early models of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Macintosh" target="_blank">Apple Macintosh</a>.

						<p>
							By the mid-90s, many of these systems were falling out of favour as Intel-based PCs -
							already dominant in the business sector - took over the home market as well.
							Nevertheless, these early computers paved the way, and if you own a smartphone or 
							other mobile device then there's a very good chance that it's powered by an 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family" target="_blank">ARM-based CPU</a>
							- a distant relative of the microprocessor that Acorn Computers invented for their 32-bit computers all the way back in 1985.
