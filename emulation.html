						<p>
							I always found emulators fascinating. It seemed impressive to be able to effectively turn one kind of computer into another or into a games console.
							Of course there are limitations, but in most cases you can get an experience that is pretty faithful to the real thing.
						</p>
						<p>
							In theory it's possible to emulate any computing device on any other computing device, 
							so long as the system running the emulator (the 'host') has slightly more memory than the one to be emulated.
							This of course doesn't mean that it will run in real-time however.
							In practice, the host system has to be several times faster than the emulated system due to often-significant overheads in the process.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first console emulators for PCs were developed in the mid-to-late 90s, with an emphasis on Nintendo systems, including the 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_blank">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, 
							released in 1985. Initially, however, these emulators had many problems with glitches and poor accuracy, 
							largely due to the fact that the exact inner workings of the systems they were trying to emulate were unknown
							to the emulator developers as they had no access to any official documentation and instead had to make educated guesses 
							through a process of 'reverse engineering'.
							Check out the video below for a bit more on this early history.
						</p>
						<div class="my-video-container">

							</iframe>
						</div>

						<p>
							As time went by and computers became more powerful, emulation of these early consoles matured, with an increasing emphasis on accuracy over speed. 
							At the same time, it became possible to emulate newer fourth generation systems such as the 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_blank">Super Nintendo System (SNES)</a>
						</p>

						<figure class="my-image-container">

								alt="Screenshot of the Snes9X Super Nintendo emulator running Super Mario World on a PC">
							<figcaption>The Snes9X Super Nintendo emulator running Super Mario World on a PC</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							Later still, it became possible to emulate even fifth generation consoles such as the
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)" target="_blank">Playstation</a> and 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)" target="_blank">Nintendo 64</a>.
							In the case of the N64, this came as a surprise to many people as the system was believed to be too advanced to emulate on the PCs of the time, 
							but one emulator had a clever trick up its sleeve, as explained by the video below.
						</p>

						<div class="my-video-container">
							<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2NF5sU_n0uk"

								allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>
							</iframe>
						</div>

						<p>
							As of writing, experimental emulators exist for at least the seventh generation of games consoles, covering systems released in the mid 2000s.
							While console developers would no doubt prefer to keep firm control of their console's ecosystems, it seems that whenever a new system is released, emulator writers
							rise to the challenge.
						</p>

						<p>
							Aside from consoles and legacy home-computers, it's also possible to emulate mobile devices, especially those running Google's open-source "Android" operating system.
							Like console emulators, some of these such as <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" target="_blank">BlueStacks</a> are geared towards making Android games available on PCs, 
							but they can also be used in a more general-purpose way. These emulators in particular offer a useful way of testing mobile software without having to run it on a real device.
							Using emulators for testing or development like this is common practice, and often there are official emulators from the likes of Google and Apple for exactly that purpose.
